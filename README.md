### RESISTOR COLOR-CODE DECODER

###### DESCRIPTION.

**<u>Resistors are basic components in any given circuits. Resistors are manufactured in small sizes rendering it impossible to 
	  label them with their values. Due to this limitation, their value is indicated in form of color bands which are decoded to 
	  get their value. Engineers have to depend on color-charts or mmemonics, pen and paper to find this value. There may be 
	  instances of inaccuracy which can prove fatal to sensitive systems. The below program serves to calculate the resistance of 
	  the common 4-band resistor.By just inputting the colors of the resistor, the user can get the value of the resistor.
	  The time spent and accuracy gained from this program is of prime significance to the user.</u>**
